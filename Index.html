            <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i>People Looking For a New Career.</h3>
            <p>Web Developers are well paid. According to Indeed, Web Developers make, on
                average, $60,000 a year in Utah. Most of our students leaving the program
                make about $16-$24 an hour, or between $33,000 to $49,000 a year upon
                graduation. Pay usually increases after about 1 year of experience.</p>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-feather-alt"></i>Entrepreneurs or Freelancers</h3>
            <p>Whether you want to make a website for your company or you want to
                Freelance and make websites for others the Web &amp; Mobile Development
                program can hlep you make your dream a reality. Many business owners don't
                have the budget to pay a Web Developer, the program will teach you how. As
                a Freelancer your income is only limited by how much you are willing to
                put into your business. Furthermore; there is nothing quite as rewarding
                as working on something you have built.</p>
